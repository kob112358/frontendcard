# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I learned a lot about troubleshooting, the position style, and honed some react form building skills. I started to incorporate some CSS modules for React towards the end of the project - I'm looking forward to fully incorporating those into all future React projects.

You can also see that I intended to start off using Typescript on this project as well, but I wanted to practice all of the other HTML/CSS/React-JS aspects a bit more first before grabbing the reins on Typescript.

Overall, a great project and I'm happy with how it turned out.
